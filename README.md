# C-Coding-Challenge

This C# console program recreates the input style of old-school mobile keypads, where each number key represents multiple letters. It lets users cycle through characters by pressing a key repeatedly, includes a backspace function for corrections, allows spacing for repeated characters, and finalizes the input with a send command.

On the mobile keypad each number represents several different letters, and when pressing the same number key multiple times the different letter options are scrolled through.

2 → A 22 → B 222 → C
To enter two consecutive characters from the same key, simply a pause/space is needed to separate them.
